## About

The Concord project was my first generative art project on fxhash. Enjoying the freedom of releasing what I wanted when I wanted and not having to worry so much about "mass appeal" allowed me to lean into the world of generative pen plotter art.

Combining my love for print and pen plotting, Concord lends itself to both, having since had prints and pen plots made of it.

The idea for Concord was a place of peace and tranquillity. The line represents structure, as though you were in the wilderness or on a strange planet and had found some bamboo-type material to construct a shelter. The circles and semi-circles are balanced, distant moons or suns view from the abode. The smaller dots take their positions in the negative space, placed where other things aren't.

This is a first part of a trilogy with; "a strange and desolate place" and "Maps" being parts two and three.

Concord: "a harmonious state of things in general and of their properties (as of colours and sounds); congruity of parts with one another and with the whole."
